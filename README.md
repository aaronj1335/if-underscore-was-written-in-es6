# if underscore was written in es6

***UPDATE:*** parts of this are out-of-date with the introduction of [lazy
evaluation in lodash][lodashlazy].

these are the slides i used for a lightning talk at an [austinjs meetup][].

if you'd like to play around with some of the es6 features described in the talk, you can try out [gunderscore][], which is an example of what it would look like to write a generator-based underscore.

i ended up making [a blog post][] out of this, and learned a lot about [the state of the implementations in relation to the spec][gist] in the process.
